# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned by reading the source code and then trying to break apart the test files that came with the code. Reading the code only got me so far and there are some parts of the larger methods that can be rather complicated and overwhelming.
The best way to account for this was to just try and fail over and over again, until I had a working understanding of the library. The Readme.MD also helped with providing descriptions of how things where supposed to work. One change that would
have made the overall process easier would have been if the numerous regex and if tests had been made more readable instead of giving each line its own space, it made it hard to take in all at once.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Raise the level of abstraction really seems to just focus on what it does, not how it does it. Don't go overboard describing how the method or works, focus on what it does. You can still talk about what a method needs or 
returns but the focus of your comment should be to talk about what it is supposed to do. If you can't take your comment to someone else and have them implement exactly what you did in any language that they choose. Your comment
is either not descriptive enough or needs to be generalized more. Overall though it is important to remeber that it is a tough process and the more experience you get writing comments the easier it gets.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> About 6 hours writing the code, comments and tests, 2 hours trying to find a sufficiently interesting and yet simple module and failing and then about 30 to 45 minutes to pick one of the modules from the provided list. All told
about 8.5 to 9 hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I used MDN in order to understand methods I wasn't quite familiar with, like .pop() and .map() for arrays. I used the package repo's readme and then I used google to understand how to install, use and format JSDocs comments.
I also used regex101.com for their regex tester to understand what patterns and character sequences the methods where specifically looking for.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I had trouble finding documentation on a way to install JSDocs globally. Could this be because I am using a windows machine? Either way JSDocs are nifty, but be prepared to read in order to understand how they work. Other than 
that, I had no really problems.
